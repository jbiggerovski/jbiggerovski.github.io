TIRZAH
DEVOTION

Romantic love.

How else could I ever describe my feelings for Tirzah Mastin’s enchanting debut? I swoon for Devotion. Miss it when it’s gone. Pine for its return to my turntable and shiver at the thought of living life without it.

Following an interminable wait between “I’m Not Dancing”, her debut single from 2013, and two EP’s for Greco-Roman, Tirzah and Mica Levi have created one of the most sincere and heartfelt records of this heartless decade.

Wavy soul, as Tirzah calls it, serves as the perfect encapsulation of Devotion’s sound, with Mica’s submerged sonics and smudged electronics serving as the ideal backdrop for Tirz’s unguarded vox.

Oscillating between R&B, Grime, and experimental pop—often within a single track—the duo achieve a brilliant sleight of hand, engendering the LP with a work-in-progress spirit. Like Arthur Russell, the intimacy of these songs evoke a kind of diaristic voyeurism, making you wonder “Should I be listening to this?” Simply put, it’s imperfect perfection.

Devotion and me? We’re in it for the long haul.

ROSALÍA
EL MAR QUERER

Sheba and I are essentially divorced.

Musically speaking, that is.
Sheba maintains her vinyl-only collection of the scuzziest Reagan-era punk this side of the Bowery, while I trundle the diminishing returns of global youth culture. Out of the two hundred+ records below, Sheba approves of four.

Four.
Fucking.
Records.

Not even enough to count on her adorably tiny thumb. (Officially, they are La Luz, Khruangbin, Amen Dunes and Beak>.)

I mention this because the first time she caught me listening to Rosalía’s El Mar Querer, she asked: "What’s this—Spanish Miley Cyrus?”

What a little hosebag, right?

Given my two (superfluous) degrees in dramatic writing and my hyperbolic tendencies (see above, below, everywhere), you’re prolly skeptical of my praises. I get it. But, for my biscuits, Rosalía Vila Tobella might be one of the most exciting pop stars to emerge in my lifetime.

Need proof? Give El Mar Querer a single spin and watch it render everything else lifeless by comparison. If not, well, you’re probably an asshole.

Either way, I promise you this: you won’t find a better vocal performance anywhere else this year. At 25, a neophyte by Flamenco standards, she already possesses one of the most pliant sopranos in pop. Witness her breeze through inhuman melismas on “Reniego” with barely a shrug , or check ”Pienso en tu mirá”, easily 2018’s best song, where Tobella and our beloved El Guincho craft a seamless mix of hyper-modernist pop and Catalonian Flamenco.
Honestly, how can you not fuck with this?!
Oh, and if you’ve yet to experience her visual universe, treat yourself.

H. TAKAHASHI
LOW POWER

There’s so much fucking noise.

It’s almost unbearable at times.

In an era of global discord, silence is often the loveliest sound. But, unless you find yourself on a sound stage, it’s nigh impossible to find. In a pinch, these microtonal compositions from H.Takahash's Low Power’s might be the next best thing.

Let’s face it: it’s a fucking disaster out there. Some of us soothe ourselves with meditation, yoga, or Xanax, but Takahashi, a Tokyo-based architect, may have discovered the most productive solution yet. In an effort to calm himself during his commute into Shinjuku, Takahashi composed a series of comforting tones on his iPhone. The result might be the most restorative albums in a deafening era.

Keen ears will hear echoes of Hiroshi Yoshimura and Satoshi Ashikawa’s architectural ambience, which is fitting, given Takahashi work as an architect. Rather than evoking artificial spaces, however, Low Power conjures a feeling of being alone in nature, where the relentless march of time disappears.

I cringe typing this, but goddamn it, Low Power possesses healing properties. Kinda like Sultan’s lentil soup. My hope is Low Power brings you the same level of joy and sanctuary it’s brought me over these last twelve months.

As the chaos continues to swirl, hold Low Power close. It’s meditative minimalism might be the perfect antidote to these noisy times. Especially if you’re a delicate flower like me.

WESTSIDE GUNN
SUPREME BLIENTELE

Westside Gunn makes me feel old.

Dunno if it’s his obsession with early 80s wrestling or his fetishization of 90s NYC rap, but Gunner engineers music solely for the grumpiest hip-hop fans who would never fuck with a Spotify playlist. If you worshipped Ric Flare, Clyde Drexler, and Mobb Deep as a kid, this is your shit.

Possessing the most distinctive voice in rap, Gunn delivers every helium-pitched verse with an encyclopedic knowledge of luxury designer fashion and wig shot wizardry. I assure you no other record from 2018 rhymed Oscar De La Renta with, “your brains get air time”. Make no mistake, this shit is colder than a December night.

Between Supreme Blientele, Hitler Wears Hermes VI, his brother Conway’s sterling Blakk Tape, and their cousin Benny’s Tana Talk 3, Gunner’s Griselda Records established themselves as the rightful heirs to a throne once occupied by Def Jam, Bad Boy, Death Row, and Cash Money. Every line the family delivered was a missile, undergirded with the clinks of coke spoons and emptied clips. If anyone could claim interstellar domination in 2018, it was the Griselda fam. BabababababaBOOM!

ELI KESZLER
STADIUM

T H I S album - fuck!
It’s impossible for me to listen Eli Keszler’s Stadium without imagining of my 18-year-old self losing my goddamn mind. With its seamless blend of avant-jazz and digital manipulation, Stadium encapsulates the sound I spent years scouring the earth to find.
After dropping out of high school, I devoted a regrettable amount of my time digging for records, mostly as a substitute for human interaction. I funneled all of my social anxiety depression into my habit, which remained an addiction until I met Sheba. After that, I immersed myself in a-n-y-thing that would make me hers. Namely Jim Jarmusch, Lux Interior, and Superdawg. And now we collect records together!
I’m usually repelled by nostalgia, but I can’t help but let it wash over me with Stadium. Drummer-led jazz groups were my thing as a teenager. Max Roach, Elvin Jones, Jack Dejohnette, Rashied Ali, Idris Muhammed—those were my gods! And now my manz Eli joins their side!
His fluttering patterns may form the foundation of his singular style, but it’s Keszler’s ability to blur the lines between what’s played and placed that reveals the true depths of his artistry.
Stadium is such a deeply special record for me, one I know will bring us plenty of jams in the years to come.

JEREMIH & TY DOLLA $IGN
MIH-TY

“Let’s have sex.”
These are the first words we hear on Mih-Ty, the lascivious collaborative LP from Jeremih and Ty Dolla $ign. Given 2018’s overabundance of toxic masculinity, most would skip to the next record immediately. And rightfully so.
But then comes the twist: “But not without your permission.” Which begs the question: is Mih-Ty the first R&B record of the post-#MeToo era?
With Chris Brown singing a hook—seriously, you couldn’t get ANYONE else?!—I  wouldn't go that far, but it’s certainly the most unintentionally hilarious record of the year. I mean, try to keep a straight face during Ty’s “Kissing, Touching, Fucking,” outro on “FYT”. It’s impossible, right?!?!
Those missteps aside, Mih-Ty is simply a fantastic R&B joint with an insanely high hit rate, an album Bad Boy would’ve killed for in ’95. Despite the excessive bravado and come-ons, the louche duo somehow bring out the best (worst?) in each other. Ty continues to master the art of tasteful auto-tune, and aside from Faith Evans, Jeremih still possesses one of the airiest falsettos in contemporary music.

Full disclosure: I’ve probably listened to Mih-Ty more than any other record here. If I was showering or washing dishes, you know damn for sure I was blasting it on the HomePod. Although I’d NEVER let her hear Mih-Ty, I’d often imagine whispering some of the lyrics into Sheebie’s ear— oh no, TMI!

BLAWAN
WET WILL ALWAYS DRY

It sounds ridiculous, but I am so proud of Jamie Roberts.

We almost never received Wet Will Always Dry, Robert’s slamming debut of utilitarian techno.
Following years of hard-partying and surgery for a life-threatening illness, things looked bleak for the prodigious producer. But then he did what any self-respecting electronic music does these days: moved to Berlin and released the best music of his career.

Since his first releases on R&S and Hessle Audio, Roberts achieved an illusive feat in electronic music: crafting an instantly identifiable sound. Ironically, that sound remains one of the most unique and otherworldly in the game. Given the dissociative qualities of ketamine, I pity the poor, unsuspecting soul hearing these alien tones for the first time inside of a dank club at peak hour.  Eesh.

Wet Will Always Dry certainly isn’t a record for everyone. These tracks contains some of the most propulsive, alien-sounding music ever made, which is a testament to Jamie’s sonic abilities. He simply hears things differently than the rest of us. Roberts' meticulous focus on timbre and tonal colors, particularly in the mid-range, remain unequaled.

But everyone knows it’s all about the drums with Blawan, and my god, does he have them for days. Check “Careless”, with its jump-rope hi-hats and a fluttering kick drum reenforced with enough side-chain compression to dislodge a filling. It’s easily one of the best tracks Jamie’s ever made.

Since the rise of EDM, I often ask myself: could I see this being played on the main stage of an outdoor music festival? If  yes, that shit gets deleted immediately. If you’re looking for festival-safe techno, check Skee Mask or Jon Hopkins—decent records, both of which can be found way below. But with Wet Will Always Dry, it's just eight perc heavy rollers.

Given Jamie’s past, I feel so lucky we even got new Blawan tunes!

TEREKKE
IMPROVISATIONAL LOOPS

Let me leave you with one more soother.

Terekke’s Improvisational Loops is less a record than a warm perfume. Composed with the lushest pads draped in tape delay and cavernous reverb, Terekke crafts a hypnotic dream of a record using only the most essential elements. Following on the heels of Plant Age, his deep house masterpiece, Improvisational Loops features the same billowing top lines minus the submerged kick drums.

If you ever wish this indifferent universe would just shut up for five goddamn seconds, Improvisational Loops will be your jam. I’ve found it's the perfect record to detach yourself from modern existence for a sec.

Run a bath, grab your Dosist, and bliss out.
Until next year...
